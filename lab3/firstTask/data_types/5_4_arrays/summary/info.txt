The length property is the array length or, to be precise, its last numeric index plus one. It is auto-adjusted by array methods.

If we shorten length manually, the array is truncated.

We can use an array as a deque with the following operations:

push(...items) adds items to the end.
pop() removes the element from the end and returns it.
shift() removes the element from the beginning and returns it.
unshift(...items) adds items to the beginning.
To loop over the elements of the array:

for (let i=0; i<arr.length; i++) – works fastest, old-browser-compatible.
for (let item of arr) – the modern syntax for items only,
for (let i in arr) – never use.
To compare arrays, don’t use the == operator (as well as >, < and others), as they have no special treatment for arrays. They handle them as any objects, and it’s not what we usually want.

Instead you can use for..of loop to compare arrays item-by-item.
