Functions are values. They can be assigned, copied or declared in any place of the code.
If the function is declared as a separate statement in the main code flow, that’s called a “Function Declaration”.
If the function is created as a part of an expression, it’s called a “Function Expression”.
Function Declarations are processed before the code block is executed. They are visible everywhere in the block.
Function Expressions are created when the execution flow reaches them.
